# internet_radio
An add-on for the Mozilla WebThings Gateway what allows you to play internet radio stations

Depends on VLC being installed. If it's not, it will try to install it.
It comes with a few default radio stations, but you can add your own.

It creates a thing with a few properties:

Select the desired station from a drop-down.
You can set the audio volume
You can turn the radio on and off

It uses persistence to remember the previous state (e.g. selected radio station, volume, playing)
