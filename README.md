# Internet-radio
An add-on for the Mozilla WebThings Gateway what allows you to play internet radio stations.

## Features
- Add your own radio stations by adding the URL's of streams
- Set the audio volume independently of the system audio volume
- Designed to work well with voice control

## TODO
- Add persistence. Currently if you restart the gateway or stop the add-on, it will forget if you were listening, which radio station you were listening to, and at what volume.
