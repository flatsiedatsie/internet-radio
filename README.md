# Internet radio
An add-on for the Mozilla WebThings Gateway what allows you to play internet radio stations

It comes with a few default radio stations, but you can add your own in the settings page.

It creates a thing with a few properties:
- Select the desired station from a drop-down.
- You can set the audio volume
- You can turn the radio on and off

It uses persistence to remember the previous state (e.g. selected radio station, volume, playing)
